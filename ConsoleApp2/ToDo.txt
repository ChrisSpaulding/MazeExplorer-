ToDo:

move this project to Github
take a text file as a maze template
	White space is a path 
	Any character other than S and G is a wall
	S (Start) is the starting position
	G (Goal) is the winning position
	

Create web front end with rest service
	Create Multiple front ends that all point to the base code. 
	I could start witha simple Windows GUI to get the logic correct
